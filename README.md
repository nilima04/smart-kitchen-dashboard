- User-centered workflows over feature complexity  
- Clear information hierarchy for multi-user environments  
- Systems thinking and extensibility  

## Planned Enhancements
- AI-assisted task prioritization and reminders  
- Predictive suggestions based on usage patterns  
- Reduced manual input through intelligent defaults  

## Status
Early-stage product exploration and system design. Actively iterating on feature definitions and future capabilities.
